Machine Learning Project – Linear Regression (Google Colab)
Project Overview

This project demonstrates the basics of Machine Learning using Linear Regression.
It shows how we can use data, train a model, and predict outputs using Python libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn.

The goal is to understand:

How data is handled in ML

How to train a regression model

How to test predictions

How to visualize results

Technologies Used

Python 3

Google Colab (for writing & running code)

NumPy (math operations)

Pandas (data handling)

Matplotlib (graph/plots)

Scikit-learn (ML model)

Steps in the Code

Import Libraries
Load all the required Python libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, sklearn).

Load Dataset
Use a sample dataset (either inbuilt or uploaded in Colab).

Data Preprocessing

Handle missing values (if any)

Select features (X) and target (y)

Train-Test Split
Divide the dataset into training data (to learn) and testing data (to check accuracy).

Build Linear Regression Model
Use LinearRegression() from sklearn to train the model.

Make Predictions
Test the model with test data.

Visualize Results
Plot graphs to see how the model fits data.

-How to Run

Open Google Colab (https://colab.research.google.com)

Upload the notebook file (.ipynb)

Run each cell step by step

Change dataset if you want to test with your own data

-Example Output

Model predictions on test data

A regression line on a scatter plot

Accuracy score of the model

-Important Questions & Answers (About the Code)
1. What is Linear Regression?

Answer: Linear regression is a machine learning algorithm that finds the relationship between input (X) and output (y) by fitting a straight line to the data.

2. Why do we split data into training and testing sets?

Answer:

Training data teaches the model.

Testing data checks if the model works well on unseen data.
This prevents overfitting.

3. What does fit() do in Linear Regression?

Answer: fit() trains the model by finding the best line (best coefficients and intercept) for the dataset.

4. What does predict() do?

Answer: predict() uses the trained model to give output (y values) for new input data (X values).

5. What libraries are important in this project and why?

Answer:

Pandas → handle data

NumPy → mathematical operations

Matplotlib → visualization

Scikit-learn → building ML models

6. How do we measure accuracy of Linear Regression?

Answer:
We can use:

R² Score (coefficient of determination) → how well data fits the model

Mean Squared Error (MSE) → average error in predictions

7. What is Overfitting in ML?

Answer: Overfitting happens when the model learns too much from training data (even noise), so it performs badly on new/unseen data.

8. Why do we visualize results with graphs?

Answer: Graphs help us see:

If the regression line fits the data properly

How predictions compare to real values
